        <h1>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h1>
        <h3>I already had some experience building web applications, so most of the knowledge gained was primarily review.</h3>
        <h1>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h1>
        <h3>I used a template.</h3>
        <h1>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h1>
        <h3>The contact form validation took the longest time.</h3>
        <h1>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</h1>
        <h3>It hasn't changed as I already had a positive view on Web Development.</h3>
        <h1>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h1>
        <h3>Make a cheat sheet for all html tags, css selectors, javascript functions, etc. It'll be much easier to reference this cheat sheet than constantly have to look for something you've forgotten through Google/documentation.</h3>
